I’m not sure where my error might occur but because of gdb I’m aware there was a double free error that occurred in my removal function. 
I used b to make a breakpoint on line 76 and use layout .src to see my code layout. I use bt to see where my double free might have occurred
but I still couldn’t see where I’m having my double free error. So, I used next and print to see where my error might occur and found that some
data is being passed in main that gives the list some random data.

I’m sure there are many errors that I am still not acquainted of but the command that I have learn in gdb would help me out with figuring out
segmentation fault and double free errors. I wish I had more time with this assignment so that I could properly understand dynamic binding and figure out
why my code is not working. Although I have additional compiling error, the reason why I believe specifically the removal may not have worked is because
I wasn’t using a look ahead approach which is needed if I don’t have a reference pointer.
